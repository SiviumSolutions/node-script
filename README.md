## Overview

**Sivium Scripts** is a collection of Bash scripts designed to streamline the setup, deployment, and maintenance of your Node.js projects. These scripts handle tasks such as dependency checks, environment configuration, automated Sentry releases, and Nginx SSL setup with Cloudflare integration. By automating these essential tasks, Sivium Scripts ensures a consistent and efficient workflow for developers and DevOps teams.

## Features

- **Dependency Management**: Automatically checks and verifies essential tools and scripts required for your project.
- **Automated Installation**: Downloads and configures necessary scripts, sets permissions, and initializes your environment.
- **Sentry Integration**: Automates the creation and management of Sentry releases based on your project's version.
- **Nginx & SSL Setup**: Configures Nginx with SSL certificates managed by `acme.sh`, integrates with Cloudflare for DNS management, and handles container registration with external services.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports various project types (backend, frontend, API, microservice) and package managers (bun, pnpm, yarn, npm).
- **Silent Mode**: Allows for non-interactive runs, suitable for CI/CD pipelines.
